# Hotel-Room-Booking-System
A simple command-line interface (CLI) based Hotel Room Booking System developed in Python. The system allows users to:
->Set up a hotel with a defined number of rooms.
->Check the number of available rooms.
->Book a room if available.
->Exit the system gracefully.

The program uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, such as classes, constructors, and instance variables, to manage hotel data efficiently.

Features:-
->Interactive menu for smooth user experience.
->Real-time room availability tracking.
->Input validation for number of rooms and menu choices.
->Encapsulation of hotel-related logic inside a Hotel class.

Technologies Used:-
->Python 
->OOP Principles
